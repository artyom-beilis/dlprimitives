# Comparing GPUs from different Vendors

## Base Line

Note we compare 3 different GPUs that have similar performance within reasonable margins.

AMD RX 6600 XT, NVidia GTX 1080, NVidia RTX 2060 Super.

The basic flops performance measured using custom kernel. Flops performance of modern GPUs can 
be calculated as clock \* cores \* 2, however clock depends on specific model and thermal
performance so both manual measures used as base line and calculated theoretical expected
flops measured using median clock observed during benchmarks.


|gpu        |GFlops  |GB/s|Cores|Clock Mhz|Exp GFlops|Exp GB/s|Flops %| Mem %|
|-----------|--------|----|-----|---------|----------|--------|-------|------|
|6600xt     |9,937   |216 |2048 |2655     |10,875    |256     |91.6%  |84.4% |
|1080       |8,970   |242 |2560 |1809     |9,262     |320     |96.9%  |75.6% |
|2060s      |8,263   |396 |2176 |1905     |8,290     |448     |98.7%  |88.4% |

So GPUs performance varies, also 2060s has 17-24% less GFlops that 6600xt it has much higher memory throghtput that helps in bandwidth limited algorithms like batch normalization of depthwise separable convolutions for mobilenet. 1080 has 10-15% lower GFlops but 12% more bandwidth.


## Training Times

Measured in ms per batch, lower is better.
